# Acronym Pass in Python

As a Quality Assurance Specialist, a traditional acronym pass in my role consists of manually searching through each lesson for acronyms/spellouts and comparing them to an Excel standards spreadsheet to see if the acronym/spellout shown in the lesson match those displayed in the Excel standards spreadsheet.

I created a text-parsing tool in Python that searches for acronyms and spellouts, parses HTML files to compare with Excel data, and outputs all spellouts and acronyms used in a lesson. This eliminates the need for manual comparison, and successfully saves the company time and money.
